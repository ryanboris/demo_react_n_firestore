> An essential overview of relevant Firestore features and how to connect them to a React application.

_Note_: I removed the lock file in order to easily allow the user to install deps using the package manager of their choice.  All deps are current as of 11/11/2019 and the installation via CRA, and considering this repo is for a single day demo, removing the lock should not cause any issues while helping to avoid the more common issue of conflicting lock files that would be the bigger possibility.

## Install

```sh
npm i or yarn
```

## Usage

```sh
npm start or yarn start
```
